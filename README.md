# Overlapping-Strings-and-MergeSort

## Overview
This project takes in two files of either int or string type.  
For each unique value in file 1, it checks for the same value in file 2.  
If it is in both files, it adds it to a result array.  
After the files have been iterated through, the result array is sorted using merge sort.  

## How to use
The command to use this file is "./a.exe {i/s} {file 1} {file 2}"  
The first argument is 'i' for integer and 's' for string
